Game played via the console that replicates the behaviour of the game 'Moonlighter'. It generates a new map each time using a tree-like data structure, having 12 rooms packed with monsters. The player needs to visit the corner/closed rooms to obtain all chests in order to win. If the player's health falls below zero before finishing the game, the player loses the game.
